## Description

This is a mock-up Ecommerce website to practise as well as demonstrate my keen eye for detail and design. This application contains 4 pages: homepage, login/sign-up, cart as well as a product page.

Since this is a mock-up, the functionalities of the usual deployed ecommerce are not demonstrated here. However, this website is set so that if I decide to incorporate APIâ€™s, backend languages and a database, it will function like a normal ecommerce would, so the potential is there.

Nevertheless, this website is fully responsive to any device.
